# BlueTaggersÔºà„Éñ„É´„Éº„Çø„ÉÉ„Ç¨„Éº„Ç∫Ôºâ

This is a Flutter application for managing Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices. It allows you to scan for nearby devices, connect to them, and view their connection status.

## Features

*   **Scan for BLE devices:** Discover nearby BLE devices.
*   **Connect to devices:** Establish a connection with a selected device.
*   **View connection status:** See which devices are currently connected and which are not.
*   **Save paired devices:** Keep a list of your paired devices for easy reconnection.
